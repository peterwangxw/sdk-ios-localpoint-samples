 The `PWLPZoneMessageManager` class is the central point for managing messages delivered to your application. A zone message manager object provides support for the following message-related activities:

 - The manager can notify its delegate or via notification when messages are added, deleted or modified.
 - The manager can mark a message as read.
 - The manager can delete a message.
